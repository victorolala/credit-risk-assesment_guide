##Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. 
It involves creating algorithms that allow computers to identify patterns, improve from experience, and make predictions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.
